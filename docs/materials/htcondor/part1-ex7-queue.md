# Bonus HTC Exercise 1.7: Explore condor_q

## Exercise Goal

`condor_q` is a handy command to check the status of your jobs, but there are many powerful options available that can give you useful information!

**The goal of this exercise is try out some of the most common options to the `condor_q` command, so that you can view jobs effectively.**

The main part of this exercise should take just a few minutes, but if you have more time later, come back and work on the extension ideas at the end to become a `condor_q` expert!

## Selecting Jobs

The `condor_q` program has many options for selecting which jobs are listed. You have already seen that the default mode is to show only your jobs in "batch" mode:

``` console
[username@ap40]$ condor_q
```

You've seen that you can view all jobs (all users) in the submit node's queue by using the `-all` argument:

``` console
[username@ap40]$ condor_q -all
```

And you've seen that you can view more details about queued jobs, with each separate job on a single line using the `-nobatch` option:

``` console
[username@ap40]$ condor_q -nobatch
[username@ap40]$ condor_q -all -nobatch
```

Did you know you can also name one or more user IDs on the command line, in which case jobs for all of the named users are listed at once?

``` console
[username@ap40]$ condor_q <USERNAME1> <USERNAME2> <USERNAME3>
```

To list just the jobs associated with a single cluster number:

``` console
[username@ap40]$ condor_q <CLUSTER>
```

For example, if you want to see the jobs in cluster `5678` (i.e., `5678.0`, `5678.1`, etc.), you use `condor_q 5678`.

To list a specific job (i.e., `cluster.process`, as in `5678.0`):

``` console
[username@ap40]$ condor_q <JOB.ID>
```

For example, to see job ID 5678.1, you use `condor_q 5678.1`.

!!! note
    You can name more than one cluster, job ID, or combination thereof on the command line, in which case jobs for
    **all** of the named clusters and/or job IDs are listed.

Let’s get some practice using `condor_q` selections!

1.  Using a previous exercise, submit several jobs.
1.  List all jobs in the queue — are there others besides your own?
1.  Practice using all forms of `condor_q` that you have learned:
    -   List just your jobs, with and without batching.
    -   List a specific cluster.
    -   List a specific job ID.
    -   Try listing several users at once.
    -   Try listing several clusters and job IDs at once.
1.  When there are a variety of jobs in the queue, try combining a username and a different user's cluster or job ID in the same command — what happens?

## Viewing a Job ClassAd

You may have wondered why it is useful to be able to list a single job ID using `condor_q`. By itself, it may not be that useful. But, in combination with another option, it is very useful!

If you add the `-long` option to `condor_q` (or its short form, `-l`), it will show the complete ClassAd for each selected job, instead of the one-line summary that you have seen so far. Because job ClassAds may have 80–90 attributes (or more), it probably makes the most sense to show the ClassAd for a single job at a time. And you know how to show just one job! Here is what the command looks like:

``` console
[username@ap40]$ condor_q -long <JOB.ID>
```

The output from this command is long and complex. Most of the attributes that HTCondor adds to a job are arcane and uninteresting for us now. But here are some examples of common, interesting attributes taken directly from `condor_q` output (except with some line breaks added to the `Requirements` attribute):

``` file
MyType = "Job"
Err = "sleep.err"
UserLog = "/home/username/intro-2.1-queue/sleep.log"
Requirements = ((OSGVO_OS_STRING == "RHEL 9"))
    && (TARGET.Arch == "X86_64")
    && (TARGET.OpSys == "LINUX")
    && (TARGET.Disk >= RequestDisk)
    && (TARGET.Memory >= RequestMemory)
    && ((TARGET.FileSystemDomain == MY.FileSystemDomain) || (TARGET.HasFileTransfer))
ClusterId = 2420
WhenToTransferOutput = "ON_EXIT"
Owner = "username"
CondorVersion = "$CondorVersion: 24.7.3 2025-04-17 BuildID: 802763 PackageID: 24.7.3-0.802763 GitSHA: bb5d9294 RC $"
Out = "sleep.out"
Cmd = "/bin/sleep"
Arguments = "120"
```

!!! note
    Attributes are listed in alphabetical order but may change from time to time.
    Do not assume anything about the order of attributes in `condor_q` output.

**See what you can find in a job ClassAd from your own job.**

1.  Write a submit file for a `sleep` job that sleeps for at least 3 minutes (executable below). Submit the job.

        :::console
        #!/bin/bash
        
        sleep 180

1.  Before the job executes, capture its ClassAd and save to a file:

        :::console
        condor_q -l <JOB.ID> > classad-1.txt

1.  After the job starts execution but before it finishes, capture its ClassAd again and save to a file

        :::console 
        condor_q -l <JOB.ID> > classad-2.txt

Now examine each saved ClassAd file. Here are a few things to look for:

-   Can you find attributes that came from your submit file? (E.g., Cmd, Arguments, Out, Err, UserLog, and so forth)
-   Can you find attributes that could have come from your submit file, but that HTCondor added for you? (E.g., Requirements)
-   How many of the following attributes can you guess the meaning of?
    -   DiskUsage
    -   ImageSize
    -   BytesSent
    -   JobStatus

## Why Is My Job Not Running?

Sometimes, you submit a job and it just sits in the queue in Idle state, never running. It can be difficult to figure out why a job never matches and runs. Fortunately, HTCondor can give you some help.

To ask HTCondor why your job is not running, add the `-better-analyze` option to `condor_q` for the specific job. For example, for job ID 2423.0, the command is:

``` console
[username@ap40]$ condor_q -better-analyze 2423.0
```

Of course, replace the job ID with your own.

Let’s submit a job that will never run and see what happens. Here is the submit file to use:

``` file
shell = hostname
output = norun.out
error = norun.err
log = norun.log
request_disk = 10MB
request_memory = 8TB
requirements = (OSGVO_OS_STRING == "RHEL 9")
queue
```

1.  Save and submit this file.
1.  Run `condor_q -better-analyze` on the job ID (this may take a minute to run).

There is a lot of output, but a few items are worth highlighting. Here is a sample (with some lines omitted):

``` file

-- Schedd: ap40.uw.osg-htc.org : <128.105.68.62:9618?...
...

Job 12635168.000 defines the following attributes:

    RequestDisk = 10240 (kb)
    RequestMemory = 8388608 (mb)

The Requirements expression for job 12635168.000 reduces to these conditions:

        Slots
Step   Matched  Condition
----- --------- ---------
[0]        7425  OSGVO_OS_STRING == "RHEL 9"
[1]        9251  TARGET.Arch == "X86_64"
[2]        7424  [0] && [1]
[5]        9241  TARGET.Disk >= RequestDisk
[7]           0  TARGET.Memory >= RequestMemory

12635168.000:  Run analysis summary ignoring user priority.  Of 9252 slots on 3328 machines,
   9252 slots are rejected by your job's requirements
      0 slots reject your job because of their own requirements
      0 slots match and are willing to run your job

WARNING:  Be advised:
   No machines matched the jobs's constraints
```

At the end of the summary, `condor_q` provides a breakdown of how **machines** and their own requirements match against my own job's requirements. 9252 total slots were considered above, and **all** of them were rejected based on **my job's requirements**. In other words, I am asking for something that is not available. But what?

Further up in the output, there is an analysis of the job's requirements, along with how many slots within the pool match each of those requirements. The example above reports that 9241 slots match our small disk request request, but **none** of the slots matched the `TARGET.Memory >= RequestMemory` condition. The output also reports the value used for the `RequestMemory` attribute: my job asked for **8 terabytes** of memory (8,388,608 MB)—of course no machines matched that part of the expression! That's a lot of memory on today's machines.

The output from `condor_q -better-analyze` may or may not be helpful, depending on your exact case. The example above was constructed so that it would be obvious what the problem was. But in many cases, this is a good place to start looking if you are having problems matching.

## Bonus: Automatic Formatting Output

**Do this exercise only if you have time, though it's pretty awesome!**

There is a way to select the specific job attributes you want `condor_q` to tell you about with the `-autoformat` or `-af` option. In this case, HTCondor decides for you how to format the data you ask for from job ClassAd(s). 
(To tell HTCondor how to specially format this information, yourself, you could use the `-format` option, which we're not covering.)

To use autoformatting, use the `-af` option followed by the attribute name, for each attribute that you want to output:

``` console
[username@ap40]$ condor_q -all -af Owner ClusterId Cmd
moate 2418 /share/test.sh
cat 2421 /bin/sleep
cat 2422 /bin/sleep
```

**Bonus Question**: If you wanted to print out the `Requirements` expression of a job, how would you do that with `-af`? Is the output what you expected? (HINT: for ClassAd attributes like "Requirements" that are long expressions, instead of plain values, you can use `-af:r` to view the expressions, instead of what it's current evaluation.)

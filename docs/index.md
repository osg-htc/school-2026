<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">Could you transform your research with vast amounts of computing?</p>

*Learn how during a week this summer at the lovely [University of Wisconsin–Madison](https://wisc.edu/)*

<p style="color: #FF6600; font-weight: bold;">Applications are now open! <a href="#applications">See below</a> for details.</p>

During the School
&mdash;
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FF6600;">July 13&ndash;17</span>
&mdash;
you will learn to use [high-throughput computing](https://htcondor.org/htc.html) (HTC) systems,
at your own campus or
using the national-scale [Open Science Pool](https://osg-htc.org/services/open_science_pool.html),
to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today’s cutting-edge science.

Through lectures, discussions, and **lots of hands-on activities** with experienced OSG staff,
you will learn how HTC systems work,
how to run and manage long lists of computing tasks and
work with huge datasets to implement a scientific computing workflow,
and where to turn for more information and help.

The School is ideal for:

*   Researchers (especially graduate students and post-docs) in any research area
    for which large-scale computing is a vital part of the research process;

*   Anyone (especially students and staff) who supports researchers
    who are current or potential users of high-throughput computing;

*   Instructors (at the post-secondary level) who teach future researchers and
    see value in integrating high-throughput computing into their curriculum.

People accepted to this program will receive financial support for
basic travel and local costs associated with the School.


## Applications

Applications are now open.
**The deadline for applications is Friday, 20 March 2026.**
Complete your application by then to ensure consideration!

To apply, complete **both** of the steps below (in parallel, if you like):

* Submit the [online application form](https://uwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cI3kiXR6ai6GcJM)
  (the link goes to a Qualtrics survey, which is the application)

* Have someone email a letter of recommendation for you to
  [school@osg-htc.org](mailto:school@osg-htc.org)
  (ideally PDF or plain text)

For the letter of recommendation, ask someone who knows you professionally&nbsp;&mdash;
ideally a faculty member or other supervisor.
They should clearly write “OSG School 2026” and your name in the subject line and letter,
so that we can associate your application and letter.

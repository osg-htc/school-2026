Learn how during a week this summer at the lovely University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison Applications are now open! See below for details. During the School \u2014 July 13\u201317 \u2014 you will learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems, at your own campus or using the national-scale Open Science Pool , to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today\u2019s cutting-edge science. Through lectures, discussions, and lots of hands-on activities with experienced OSG staff, you will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage long lists of computing tasks and work with huge datasets to implement a scientific computing workflow, and where to turn for more information and help. The School is ideal for: Researchers (especially graduate students and post-docs) in any research area for which large-scale computing is a vital part of the research process; Anyone (especially students and staff) who supports researchers who are current or potential users of high-throughput computing; Instructors (at the post-secondary level) who teach future researchers and see value in integrating high-throughput computing into their curriculum. People accepted to this program will receive financial support for basic travel and local costs associated with the School. Applications \u00b6 Applications are now open. The deadline for applications is Friday, 20 March 2026. Complete your application by then to ensure consideration! To apply, complete both of the steps below (in parallel, if you like): Submit the online application form (the link goes to a Qualtrics survey, which is the application) Have someone email a letter of recommendation for you to school@osg-htc.org (ideally PDF or plain text) For the letter of recommendation, ask someone who knows you professionally \u2014 ideally a faculty member or other supervisor. They should clearly write \u201cOSG School 2026\u201d and your name in the subject line and letter, so that we can associate your application and letter. Contact Us \u00b6 The OSG School is the premier training event of the OSG Consortium and is held annually at UW\u2013Madison.
